# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the daily programming challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). Every year, I participate in the Advent of Code event, where I solve algorithmic puzzles, improving my coding skills and problem-solving ability. The solutions are implemented in various programming languages (based on the challenge), and I aim to provide clean, efficient, and optimized code.

## Structure:
- Each day's challenge is stored in its respective folder, named according to the challenge date (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.).
- The code for each day’s challenge is accompanied by the input/output examples as provided in the problem statement.

## Languages Used:
- Python
- JavaScript
- C++

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abishek0411/advent-of-code.git
2. Navigate to the respective day’s folder to view the solution and input/output examples.
